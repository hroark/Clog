## Clogger

This is a simple project to get my (or anyone with Ideas) skills back up in C# and test out an application with the "Chain of Resposibility" pattern.

I welcome onyone who wants to contribute, either by writing a Clogger or contributung to the core.
I am well aware that this is not anything groundbreaking, but a nice place to practice, learn, or just comeup with ideas to make things better.

Please have fun and be your best self....cheesy yet true.
